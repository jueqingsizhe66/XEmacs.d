* This is a fork of [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/download/fic-ext-mode.el][fic-ext-mod.el]]

I've decided to rename it back to the canonical fic-mode.el.

* Other changes
** remove lighter
I would normally use `diminish', but it is really silly to have any
highlighter for this mode.
** call font-lock-fontify-buffer in init
* WHY U NO PROVIDE JUMP-TO functionality???

Because you should use occur or anything-regexp.
