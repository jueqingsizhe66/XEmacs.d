# What is aweshell?

I created `multi-term.el` and use it many years.

Now I'm a big fans of `eshell`.

So I wrote `aweshell.el` to extend `eshell` with these features:

1. Create and manage multiple eshell buffers.
2. Add some useful commands, such as: clear buffer, toggle sudo etc.
3. Display extra information and color like zsh, powered by `eshell-prompt-extras'
4. Add Fish-like history autosuggestions, powered by `esh-autosuggest', support histories from bash/zsh/eshell.
5. Validate and highlight command before post to eshell.
6. Change buffer name by directory change.
7. Add completions for git command.
8. Fix error `command not found' in MacOS.
9. Integrate `eshell-up'.
10. Unpack archive file.
11. Open file with alias e.
12. Output "did you mean ..." helper when you typo.
13. Make cat file with syntax highlight.
14. Alert user when background process finished or aborted.

# Installation
