QUERY is an `org-ql' query sexp.

ACTION is a function which is called on each matching entry, with
point at the beginning of its heading.  For example,
`org-element-headline-parser' may be used to parse an entry into
an Org element (note that it must be called with a limit
argument, so a lambda must be used to do so).  Also see
`org-ql--add-markers', which may be used to add markers
compatible with Org Agenda code.

If NARROW is non-nil, buffers are not widened.

`scheduled', `todo', and `priority'."
