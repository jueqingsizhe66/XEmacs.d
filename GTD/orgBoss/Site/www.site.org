https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/27202/how-do-i-install-gnutls-for-emacs-25-1-on-windows/27251#27251

@StuartHickinbottom explained what I was doing wrong: using libgnutls-28.dll 
when Emacs 25.1 requires the newer and incompatible libgnutls-30.dll.
Then it was a matter of finding binaries of libgnutls-30.dll and other required libraries.
Thankfully Phillip Lord has compiled Windows versions of all the GnuTLS libraries and dependencies and 
many other libraries you might want for Emacs! 
They are available here: get emacs-25-i686-deps.zip if you use 32-bit Windows and get emacs-25-x86_64-deps.zip 
if you use 64-bit; then unzip in the root folder of your Emacs installation (so that the bin folder of the zip
files gets decompressed into the bin folder of your Emacs installation, etc.)

Hooks(特别好的一个词,一个进步点，有点像是callback和closure的机制)
Hooks are lists of functions that are called from Emacs Lisp in order to modify the behaviour of something. For example, different modes have their own hooks so that you can add functions that will run when that mode is initialized. You saw this example earlier in the module:


(add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
add-hook的第一个hook代表监听端口(监听函数),当一触发这个函数，则执行后面的第二个参数(对应一个函数或者一个hook)

http://y.tsutsumi.io/emacs-from-scratch-part-3-extending-emacs-with-elisp.html (hooks介绍)
Emacs provides a nice hook implementation. pass in the hook name you want to listen to, and the function name you want to call.

This is equivalent to:

(add-to-list 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'turn-on-eldoc-mode)
It adds the turn-on-eldoc-mode function to the list of functions
when a buffer is initialized with emacs-lisp-mode.



http://sachachua.com/blog/series/read-lisp-tweak-emacs/

**  Adding more features to Emacs
Most Emacs libraries are not loaded automatically. This saves memory and keeps things simpler.
 Some of the customizations you may want to make require that other parts of Emacs are loaded first.
 For example, if you want to define a key for the c-mode-map (used for editing C code)
 or add a function to org-mode-hook (called when a buffer is set up with Org Mode), 
 those libraries need to be loaded first. You can load libraries by using require, like this:

(require 'org)
This loads the org library. require looks for a file named after the name provided to it,
 loads it, and double-checks that the library includes (provide 'feature-name-goes-here).
 It signals a Cannot open load file error if the library is not found. If the library 
exists but does not provide that symbol, you’ll get a Required feature FEATURE was not provided error instead.

Note that the symbol you give to require might not be the same as the function you call.
 For example, c-mode is actually defined in the cc-mode library, while org-mode is defined in org.
 To find out what file a function is defined in, use C-h f (describe-function) followed by the name of the function.
 The first line will tell you what file the function is defined in, if any. For example, c-mode‘s definition starts with:

c-mode is an interactive autoloaded compiled Lisp function in
`cc-mode.el'.
The first part of the filename (before the .el or .elc) is usually what you would use with require.
 If you have the source installed (the .el file), you can look for the (provide ...) expression to find the actual symbol to use.

How to use language to create value.


what is language?

language(writing) is to help the reader to read in the adequate process(logical process)
Creating value for the reading process.


Tell what the paper will be about?(研究对象） But I don't care, It is no value to me.
Writing is being about sth? no!no! Not about describing sth.（教学式风格，只是介绍！不好）

What the paper will argue? argue that!
Tell us about question the paper will answer?! Yes.
(means: Tell you about question you care the paper will answer！）
The question implies that I am watching your eyes, I know what you think, you are wrong.


读者觉得不好（slow down---annoy---stop不看了)

Your jod is  not reveal your head, but to change the head of your reader.(That is it)

I look at your eye, I know what you think! But You are wrong!


I know what you need, and I can do that!


I need to become stronger ,to make myself different.(work harder, read my money holders)

We want to be distracted? yes or not!

The laugage is social, is not just about you(yourself), is about to communicate with 
the people. 

Why they read it! Social makes the language be alive!!

The laugage is used to communicate with others, not just what your head reveals).
Lauguage is the relationship betweeen peoples.(语言其实是人与人之间的关系)



They don't trust you, they doubt you!
Every writer should look at readers' eyes and say you are wrong! I can give you valuable advice.

Who is reading it? You just try to answer reader want.(You are trained to think about what
you think about ,what you care about, rather than your reading caring about)

English---English works! -----Focus--




When graduate students envision themselves working outside academia,
 they often worry about writing.  This is sensible: academics who 
work outside academia are endlessly criticized for writing "like
 a professor".  Worse, writers who are criticized in this way are
 often baffled at how to adapt to their new world.  Very often,
 they try to change aspects of their writing that are not troublesome,
 and they leave in place aspects of their writing that are making their writing less clear,
 less logical, and less valuable to their readers. 
 
This session will be about a few patterns of writing that are likely to aggravate non-academic readers.
We'll focus on patterns that are often difficult for academics to see,
but are actually fairly easy to change.

Referring to Sources
 
One of the distinguishing features of academic writing is that it is informed by what is already known, what work has been done before, and/or what ideas and models have already
been developed. Thus, in academic texts, writers frequently make reference to other studies and to the work of other authors. It is important that writers guide their readers through
this literature. This section of Academic Phrasebank lists some of the phrases that writers may use for this purpose.A note on the literature review: It is the purpose of the literature
review section of a paper or dissertation to show the reader, in a systematic way, what is already known about the research topic as a whole, and to outline the key ideas and
theories that help us to understand this. As well as being systematic, the review should be evaluative and critical of the studies or ideas which are relevant to the current work. For
example, you may think a particular study did not investigate some important aspect of the area you are researching, that the author(s) failed to notice a weakness in their methods,
or that their conclusion is not well-supported (refer to Being Critical).

A note on referencing style: The way a writer refers to other sources varies somewhat across different disciplines. In some cases, where the individual author is important, the
author’s name will be the main subject of the sentence; in other cases, the author’s name may only be mentioned in brackets ( … ) or via a number notation system (e.g. footnotes
and endnotes). The ‘author as subject’ style is less common in the empirical disciplines (sciences) and more commonly used in the humanities. Different referencing systems are
used in different disciplines. In the majority of the examples given here, the Harvard in-text referencing system has been used.

A note on verb tenses: For general reference to the literature, the present perfect tense (have/has + verb participle) tends to be used. For reference to specific studies carried out in
the past, the simple past tense is most commonly used. This is normally the case where a specific date or point in time in the past forms a part of the sentence. When referring to
the words or ideas of writers, the present tense is often used if the ideas are still relevant, even if the author is no longer alive. The examples given below reflect these general
patterns, but these are by no means rigid.

 Scientist are writers too.

 
What a control?


writing with other persons(many people ,co-authors)


how to analyse things?

*** reader perspective
Who is reading this document? what do they need from it and
how are they going to behave now (they don't know, they know sth)
From reader perspective!


Writing a scientific research article is like shooting a football
as far as you can in the football field  
(就刚好像发射火箭一样，最后在轨道运行的只有那么一小部分，写作也是一样，刚开始
一大坨，慢慢变少。。。这个过程是耗能的过程takes energy)

You are sitting in the lab convincing yourself that your
data are real before you convincing sb else

structure+substance(what does it mean, what the writers wanna tell me)

Reader read structure first and then substance!

How do reader figure out emphasis?
You want reader to emphasis what？ Pay Attention to what?

*** reader interpret text
Reader interpret the text that is written by the writer
Writer try to explain everything to the reader. 

reader takes energy to read paper,first what is the structure
for the paper, second what does it mean.
What the reader put more emphasise into 

*** 强调句
1. Main clause(independent clause, free-standing clause)---structure占据80%读者分析时间
2. Sub clause(dependent clause, subordinate clause)
   
3. Main Clause(put more energy into it)

4. End placement(Put the main clause at the end place), put the 
   negative at the end, if reader like it! Put the positive
   thought if the reader like it

5. length(so many times, so many words.. intensifier增强剂, more energy to 
   finish it. So much time and energy to finish it.

6. repetition (the place of result, the end of the introduction ,
   the process of the discussion)

7. Semantics(the most importance ..)



What's the sentence(written by the writer) want to 
send to your head?????What are the writer trying to
send message to you ???

What is the readers' response? The data will not change,
but the reader response will change!


Split your structure!!!Put the subordinate early and main
clause at the end, and make that main clause much more
longer.(To make the communication more clear)


Although fred(En fred's story) is a nice guy, he(Still about fred)
commit(commit what, tax,or anything else)  genocide(fuck ,dame)

Fred commit genocide although fred is a nice guy.(fuck!)

Thinking the order of judge from your reader.

It is a few or total?


An exciting but somewhat flawed application?
Somewhat flawed but exciting application?
Somewhat flawed but true exciting application?(better)
Somewhat flawed but mmm(un un un) exciting application.

Revise makes data into different direction , to more favorable?
to more negative?(your left hands is negative, your
right hand is positive, when you split the words bump
into your eye, it is all be your hands(left and right)


Learn anything from variationS!


***  Stop there and think about  the main clause and subordinate clause
Stop there! think about it

people put more emphasise in the end.

*** tweak the structure


Between Subject and verbs don't insert too much
complicated information, because people don't 
want to put more energy into them.

subordinate clause de-emphasise the meaning
main clause emphasise the meaning


*** Your think will change with the stable data in the different structures
Your data cannot speak, let the structure speak it!
You will change thinking, but data will not! That
is the most interesting things!

(maybe we will only care main statement , maybe only we will
care about the end statement. Most people don't read like you!)

If you wanna bad news will occur in the reader's mind,
 put the bad news(substance) in the main clause at the end place, 99%
will get the bad news(you can predict)

If you wanna positive, you put the good news in the main clause at the
end placement, then you can predict the majority of the reader
will get the good news

**** split and makes the sentence ambivalent
You can also be ambivalent(矛盾）  
main is bad news, end-clause is good
main is much worse news, end-clause is good
main is bad news, end-clause is better

main is good news, end- clause is bad.
main is good news, end- clause is much worse.
main is better news, end- clause is bad.


You have to listen what the reader say.
Listen to the readers!
(Do you mean this?!)
