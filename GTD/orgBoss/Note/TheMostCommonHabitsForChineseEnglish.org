* TMCH
This paper presents some of the most common Chinese-English habits 
observed from over two hundred English technical papers by Chinese
writers. The habits are explained and in most cases, example text 
from an actual paper is given along with preferred text. An attempt 
is made to explain how to correct and prevent such mistakes. In some 
cases a possible explanation of why the habit occurs is also given. This paper can serve as an individual guide to editing technical papers especially when a native English-speaking editor is unavailable.

** Introduction
Most Chinese universities require their doctoral and master 
candidates in technical and scientific fields to publish at least
one English paper in an international journal as a degree 
requirement. However, many factors make this task difficult to 
accomplish. First, previous English studies may not have focused 
enough on writing, let alone technical writing. Current studies 
may not include English, causing the writers English fluency level 
to decline. Second, most writers have never lived in an English
-speaking country. Third, due to the special aspects of technical
writing, even native English-speaking engineering students have 
a technical writing course as part of their study.

Too often, students’ papers are returned unaccepted because of 
poor English. If available, students may have their papers edited 
by a native English speaker. However,  this can get expensive for 
a department that has many students with each paper typically 
needing to be edited twice. Hiring someone to edit papers is 
difficult, costly and only puts a patch over the problem. A native 
English speaker can do a good job at getting rid of most of the 
grammatical mistakes. However, if this person does not have a 
technical background, particularly in the area of the papers he 
is editing, he is unable to get rid of  all of the mistakes and 
make sure that the meaning is clear. He cannot recognize the 
incorrect translation of technical terms for which there is a 
standard word. Such mistakes will not be picked up by the 
processor’s spelling and grammar checker.  In addition, if  they 
are not familiar with the topic or field, they may not grasp the 
meaning of the entire article and fail to make critical edits.

Hiring a person with a technical background similar to that of 
the papers being edited is a better option. Nevertheless, while a 
person with a technical background may  be able to edit the paper 
sufficiently, he may not be able to explain to the writer how to 
prevent such mistakes in the future.  Besides, it is difficult for 
most Chinese universities  to hire such staff simply for editing. 
Universities may consider inviting a visiting scholar who will 
edit papers in addition to doing research or teaching as part of 
an exchange. 

Although editing may be the fastest way to publish papers, it does 
little in the way of teaching the writers how to prevent common 
mistakes and colloquial habits that  prevent a clear understanding 
of the writer’s ideas. Writers who have already obtained an 
impressing command of the English language can only truly benefit 
if they are made aware of their common mistakes and colloquial 
habits and how to prevent them.

** Purpose
The purpose of this report is to introduce the most common habits 
in Chinese-English writing as noted from the over two hundred
papers I have edited. The habits include grammar mistakes, 
colloquialisms, and formatting problems and in most cases prevent 
a clear understanding of the writer’s ideas. A few of the habits, 
such as writing extremely long sentences, can be corrected with 
careful use of the MS Word® grammar and style checker. However,
most habits, such as missing articles, go unnoticed by automatic 
grammar checking devices. Still, Chinese-English colloquial habits 
are not recognized by such software tools.

** Structure
The common habits are presented in two sections. The first section 
lists the habits that, in my opinion, need the most attention. 
These habits interrupt the flow of the paper making it difficult 
to understand and occur most frequently. In this section, the 
habits are explained, example sentences from actual papers are
given to show the habits, and the sentences are rewritten to show 
the correct way to write them. In the case of missing articles, 
a flow chart is also given to aid in choosing the correct articles.
In the second section, an additional list of habits is given. In 
some cases, example sentences are given. In other cases, advice is 
given. The second section is very useful in becoming familiar with 
small nuances. Not all of the common habits I observed are 
presented mainly because they can only be dealt with on an 
individual basis. For example, writers had difficulty titling 
their papers and naming new technical ideas to express their 
contents and functions concisely. This problem frequently occurred
but it can only be addressed individually. Once writers are aware 
of their habits, they would be able to write better technical 
English articles.


** Section 1

*** “a, an, the”
The single most common habit is the omission of articles a, an,
and the. This occurs because Mandarin has no direct equivalent 
of articles and the rules for using them are somewhat
complicated for a non-native speakers.

Articles signal that a noun will follow and that any modifiers 
between the article and the noun refer to that noun (a big blue 
bicycle / the first award). A and an are indefinite articles; 
the is a definite article. Every time a singular noncount noun,
a common noun that names one countable item, is used the noun 
requires some kind of determiner.
 


Mistake:	The, a, and an are 
    1) omitted where they are required,
    2) used where they are not needed or contribute to wordiness 
    3) used wrongly in place of the correct article.

Examples of incorrect usages:

**** Incorrect
	Figure 2 shows the distribution of relative velocity 
        on surface of main and splitter blades.15
**** Correct
	Figure 2 shows the distribution of relative velocity 
        on the surface of the main and splitter blades.15

**** Incorrect
	The software PowerSHAPE is chosen to be a 3D modeling
        tool; it is good at dealing with free surfaces and 
        curves.4
**** Correct
	The software PowerSHAPE is chosen to be the 3D modeling 
        tool; it is good at dealing with free surfaces and 
        curves.4. There was only one 3D modeling tool used in 
        this study, therefore ‘3D modeling tool’ is specific 
        and requires the article the.

**** Incorrect
	A theoretical method for calculating the inner 
        flow-field in centrifugal impeller with splitter blades
        and investigation of the interactions between main and
        splitter blades is presented in this paper. The 
        vortices are distributed on the main and splitter blades 
        to simulate the effects of flows. Systematical study of 
        number and distribution of vortices is conducted.15

        Theoretically, remanufacturing could fully take advantage 
        of resources contained in EOF product thereby minimizing 
        impact on environment to the greatest extent compared 
        to landfill or recycling of materials; consequently it 
        contributes greatly to resource conservation.16
**** Correct

        the impact on the environment to the greatest extent compared 
        to landfill or recycling of materials; consequently it contributes 
        greatly to resource conservation.16

*** Definitions:

**** Articles	
    Also called determiners or noun markers, articles are 
    the words a, an, and the. A and an are indefinite articles, 
    and the is a definite article. Articles signal that a
 

**** Noun 
    Noun will follow and that any modifiers between the article 
    and the noun refer to that noun. ( a cold , metal chair/ the 
    lightning-fast computer).

**** Determiners
  A word or word group, traditionally identified as an 
  adjective, that limits a noun by telling how much or how many
  about it. (expression of quantity, limiting adjective
  , marker) They tell whether a noun is general (a tree) or 
  specific (the tree). The   is a definite article. Before a 
  noun, the conveys that the known refers to a specific item (
  the plan). A and an are indefinite articles. They convey that 
  a noun refers to an item in a nonspecific or general 
  way (a plan).

**** Common nouns
  A noun that names a general group, place, person , or thing: 
  dog, house.

**** Count noun
  A noun that names an item or items that can be 
  counted: radio, streets, idea, fingernails.

**** Noncount nouns
  A noun that names a thing that cannot be counted: water, time.

**** Specific noun
  A noun understood to be exactly and specifically referred to; 
  uses the definite article the.

**** Nonspecific noun
  A noun that refers to any of a number of identical 
  items; it takes the indefinite articles a , an.

** Very long sentences

Very long sentences are especially common in Chinese-English 
writing because the writers often translate directly from Chinese 
to English. Although, in Chinese writing it is acceptable 
to put several supporting ideas in on sentence to show their 
relationship,   in English, the main idea and each supporting idea 
is typically written in separate sentences. One can usually 
recognize a very long sentence by its length – sixty words or more.
However, sentences of smaller lengths can also be too long if they 
contain  multiple statements that confuse the main idea. Long 
sentences can be avoided by limiting each sentence to one or two 
topics. Semicolons should be used where the writer really wants to 
emphasize the relationship between ideas.


*** Too long	
    According to the characteristic of fan-coil air-conditioning 
    systems, this paper derives the cooling formula of fan-coil 
    units based on the heat transfer theories and puts forward 
    a new method to gauge cooling named Cooling Metering on 
    the Air-side, which can monitor the individual air-conditioning 
    cooling consumption during a period of time by detecting the 
    parameters of inlet air condition – temperature and humidity– 
    of the fan-coil air-conditioning system as well as the parameters
    of inlet cooling water provided by the chiller.


*** Correct	
    This paper derives the cooling formula of fan-coil units 
    based on the characteristics of fan-coil air-conditioning 
    systems and heat transfer theories, and puts forward a new 
    method to gauge cooling called Cooling Metering on the Air
    -side. The new method can monitor individual air-conditioning
    cooling consumption during a  period of time by detecting the 
    condition of inlet air – temperature and humidity–of 
    the fan-coil air-conditioning system as well as the 
    parameters of the inlet cooling water provided by the chiller.


*** Too long	
    The gear transmission is grade seven, the gear gap is 0.00012 
    radians, the gear gap has different output values corresponding 
    to any given input value, non- linearity of the gear gap 
    model can be described by using the phase function method
    , the existing backlash block in the non-linear library 
    of the Matlab/zdimulink toolbox can be used, the initial 
    value of gear gap in the backlash block is set to zero.9

*** Correct	
    The gear transmission is grade seven. The gear gap, which 
    is 0.00012 radians, has different output values corresponding 
    to any given input value. The non-linearity of the gear gap 
    model can be described by using the phase function method. 
    The existing backlash block in the non-linear library of 
    the Matlab/zdimulink toolbox can be used; the initial value of 
    gear gap in the backlash block is set to zero.

Another type of super-long sentence that frequently occurs in 
technical papers is that of a list. The writer wants to give 
a large amount of data, usually parameter values, and puts this 
information into one long, paragraph-sized sentence. However, 
the best way to give such type and quantity of information is 
to tabulate it (put it in a bulleted list).


*** Too long 
   The clear height of the case is 6.15 meters; the thickness of 
   the roof is 0.85 meters; the thickness of the bottom is 0.90 
   meters, the overall width is 26.6 meters, the overall length 
   of the axial cord is 304.5 meters, the length of the jacking
   section is about 148.8 meters; the weight of the case is 
   about 24127 tons.3
   
*** Clear	
  •	Case clearance height	6.15 meters
	•	Roof thickness	0.85 meters
	•	Bottom thickness	0.90 meters
	•	Overall width	26.6 meters
	•	Overall length of the axial cord	304.5 meters
	•	Length of the jacking section	148.8 meters (approx.)
	•	Weight of the case	24127 tons (approx.)


*** Prefacing the main idea of a sentence by stating the purpose, location or reason first

Chinese writers often preface the main topic of a sentence by 
first However, this has the effect of demoting the importance 
of the main idea and making the reader think the author is 
indirect. Bring the main idea to the beginning of the sentence 
stating any locations, reasons, etc., afterwards.

**** Incorrect	
For the application in automobile interiors, this paper studies 
the nesting optimization problem in leather manufacturing. 5
**** Correct
This paper studies the nesting optimization problem in leather 
manufacturing for application in automobile interiors.

widely used in industry and rapid prototype methods[5][6] 
bring a huge economical benefits, the advantage of constructing 
3D model[7][8][9] becomes extremely obvious.2
**** Correct

extremely obvious especially when numerical control (NC) techniques
[4] are widely used in industry and rapid prototype methods[5][6] bring a huge economical benefits.

**** Incorrect	
Inside the test box, the space was filled with asbestos.15
**** Correct

**** Incorrect	
In practice, we employed this approach to dispose of a 
wheelhouse subassembly of one kind of auto-body, and the 
results show that this method is feasible.16
**** Correct

of one kind of auto-body, and the results show that this method is feasible.

**** Incorrect	
To ensure sheet metal quality as well as assembly quality
, CMMs are widely used in automotive industry production.16
**** Correct	
CMMs are widely used in automotive industry production to ensure 
sheet metal quality as well as assembly quality.



*** Tendency of placing phrases which indicate time at the beginning of a sentence

**** Incorrect	
When U is taken as the control parameter, the 
BDs for � =0.0, 0.001, 0.005 are shown in Fig. 8.
**** Correct	
Figure 8 shows the BDs for � =0.
0, 0.001, and 0.005 when U is taken as the control parameter.


*** Place the most important subject at the beginning of the sentence for emphasis

**** Incorrect	
Based on the triangulation structure built from unorganized points or 
a CAD model, the extended STL format is described 
in this section.4
**** Correct	
The extended STL format is described in this section based 
on the triangulation structure built from unorganized points or a 
CAD model.

**** Incorrect	
The 3D dentition defect and restoration element models are designed 
precisely with complicated surfaces.4
**** Correct	
The 3D dentition defect and restoration element models with complicated 
surfaces are designed precisely.



*** “which/ that”
The antecedent (noun or pronoun) to which which 
refers is not specific, causing confusion.

Antecedent	The noun or pronoun to which a pronoun refers.

‘The Shijiazhuang south road underground bridge possesses the largest 
jacking force, which is built at 1978(10680t).’ [‘Shijiazhuang 
south road underground bridge possesses the largest jacking force which 
is built at 1978(10680t).’

Absolute truths in paleontology are often elusive, and even 
the filmmakers were surprised at the fierce arguments that split 
the scientists when an initial brainstorming session was else.
 



*** ‘Respectively’ and ‘respective’

Respectively refers back to two or more persons or things 
only in the order they were previously designated or mentioned
. If two lists are given, respectively pairs the 
list entries according to the order in which they are 
given. In this case the use of respectively is to allow the 
writer to give a lot of information without confusing the 
reader or writing several short sentences. Respectively is usually 
at the end of the sentence. In both cases, mentioning the order 
must be important to the meaning of the sentence otherwise 
it is not used.

For example: Bobby, Nicole and Daren wore red, 
green and blue coats, respectively.

                | List 1 |      | List 2        |
                |--------+------+---------------|
                | Bobby  | wore | a red coat.   |
                | Nicole | wore | a green coat. |
                | Daren  | wore | a blue coat.  |

Respective to two or more persons or things only in 
the order they were previously designated or mentioned.

The uses of these two words are usually incorrect or 
confusing as in the following examples.

1.	Respectively is misplaced in the sentence; it is put before the nouns to which it refers.

**** Incorrect	
Equations 2�6 can be respectively linearized as:……(equations given)…13
**** Correct	
Equations 2�6 can be linearized as:……(equations given)…, respectively.

**** Incorrect	
The weights of the two experts are respectively 0.600 and 0.400.19
**** Correct	
The weights of the two experts are 0.600 and 0.400, respectively.


2.	Respectively is inserted to express that there is a certain order in which something was done.  However, the order is already implied elsewhere in the sentence or does not need  to be expressed because it does not add value to meaning of the sentence.

**** Incorrect 
If both the core technology score and core quality score of a bottleneck process  are, respectively, below certain scores, then we refer to strategy 1, otherwise, if either is, respectively, above a certain score, then we refer to strategy 2.
Similarly, if the core technology and core quality are, respectively, above a certain score, then we refer to strategy 3, otherwise, if either is, respectively, below a certain score, then we refer to strategy 4.19
**** Correct	
If both the core technology score and core quality score of a bottleneck process are below certain scores, then we refer to strategy 1, otherwise, if either is  above a certain score, then we refer to strategy 2. Similarly, if the core technology and core quality are above a certain score, then we refer to strategy
 

3, otherwise, if either is below a certain score, then we refer to strategy 4.

**** Incorrect	
Then, the rows of vortex due to both of the long and short blades are transformed into two singularities on the  -plane and integrate the induced
velocity along the blades respectively.20
**** Correct	
Then, the rows of vortex due to both of the long and short blades are transformed into two singularities on the  -plane and integrate the induced
velocity along the blades.


4.	In addition to 2, it is unclear to what ‘respectively’ refers.

**** Incorrect	
        The dynamic characteristics of a rotor with asymmetric stiffness or with initial warp have been studied before respectively [1-4]
**** Correct
	The dynamic characteristics of a rotor with asymmetric stiffness or with initial warp have been studied before [1-4].

**** Incorrect
	The inlet and outlet temperature of the air cooler were measured using two thermocouples respectively.17
**** Correct
	The inlet and outlet temperature of the air cooler were measured by using two thermocouples.



*** ‘In this paper’, ‘in this study’
Two errors occur when these phrases are used. The 
first is overuse. In some papers written by Chinese
, these phrases can occur as much as twice per page. In papers 
written by native English writers these phrases are reserved for 
primarily two uses
1. In the introduction and conclusion to emphasize the content of 
    the paper.
2. In the body of the paper, after referring to work not done
   the author such as in other journal articles or in standard.

Therefore, if either phrase occurs more than three times 
in a paper, its use is questionable. Actually, the reader is 
aware that the work presented is by the author (unless the 
author states otherwise) so there is no reason to repeat these 
phrases. The second error is more subtle. The two phrases 
are interchanged.

**** Awkward
In this paper, IDEAS was used to ….
**** Correct
In this study, IDEAS was used to….

**** Awkward
In the paper, a SZG4031 towing tractor is used as the 
sample vehicle, it components equivalent physical parameters are obtained 
by UG design and testing.9
**** Correct
In this study, a SZG4031 towing tractor is used 
as the sample vehicle, it components equivalent physical parameters 
are obtained by UG design and testing.
 

The ‘study’ is the work the author/
s did.  The paper is the mode to present 
this work and  is what the reader is holding/ 
reading. Keep in mind the writer can also use 
other phrases such as ‘in this research’, and 
‘this paper present’.

*** Numbers and Equations

Two very common errors are those concerning the presentation of 
Arabic numerals, and equations. Chinese writers usually write 
Arabic numerals instead of spelling out the word. The 
use of Arabic numerals, itself, is not an error however; they 
should never be used at  the beginning of sentences.

**** Incorrect
	12 parameters were selected for the experiment.
**** Correct
	Twelve parameters were selected for the experiment.

In addition, Arabic numerals are overused. Arabic numerals
should be used to give data in technical papers, however they 
should not be used to give general information.

**** Incorrect
	All 3 studies concluded that the mean temperature should 
        be 30°C.
**** Correct
        All three studies concluded that the mean temperature should be 
        30°C.

This probably stems from the fact that Mandarin is a symbolic 
language and not alphabetic. Thus, the writer will find it 
easier to write a symbol that expresses the idea instead of 
the word. This problem is even more serious when equations 
are used in place of words in a way that is not practiced by 
native English speakers. Consider the following examples.

Equations should be introduced as much as possible, not 
inserted in place of words. Most journals, like the 
International Journal of Production Research, discourage 
the use of even short expressions within the text.

**** Incorrect
	If the power battery SOC > SOClo and the driving 
        torque belongs to the middle load,…
**** Correct
        If the power battery SOC is greater than SOClo and the 
        driving torque belongs to the middle load,…

**** Incorrect
	All 3 studies concluded that the mean temperature should
        be 30°C.
**** Correct
	All three studies concluded that the mean temperature 
        should be 30°C.

*** Format

Paragraphs
A paragraph is a group of sentences that develop one topic or 
thought. Paragraphs are separated to indicate the end of one 
idea or thought and the beginning of another. All English 
paragraphs start on a new line with an indent of about 
one inch or
 

with an extra line between the two paragraphs. The latter is 
more typical for business writing. Chinese students are often 
puzzled by separating paragraphs; the may perform one of two 
error. One error occurs when the writer fails to distinguish 
between two paragraphs. Although the new paragraph starts on 
a new line, there is no indentation, therefore, the reader in 
is not aware of the change in paragraphs or ideas. The second 
error occurs when a paragraph is preceded by a single sentence 
on a single line. The single line is indented along with the 
succeeding paragraph as in example #. This commonly occurs in 
Chinese texts but is never done in English.

*** ‘Figure’ and ‘Table’

The abbreviations for figure and table are Fig. and Tbl
, respectively. However, the abbreviation of table is rarely 
seen in text. One can also write fig. for figure. However, 
one should choose one convention and use it throughout the paper
. You should not switch between, Figure, figure, Fig, or fig. 
In addition, abbreviations are not used at the  beginning of 
sentences and a space belongs between the word/ abbreviation and 
the number.

**** Incorrect
	Figure.6, Figure6, Fig.6, Tbl10
**** Correct
	Figure 6, Fig. 6, Tbl. 10

*** Variables

Variables, especially those of the English alphabet, should 
be italicized in technical papers to distinguish them from English 
words. Of course, this depends on the style required by the 
journal.

*** Capitals
Be careful that capitals are not in the middle of the sentence.

**** Incorrect
	In table 1, The mark…
**** Correct
	In table 1, the mark…

*** ‘such as’ and ‘etc.’

Such as and etc. are commonly misused by Chinese
-English writers. Such as means ‘for example’ and implies that 
an incomplete list will follow; etc. means ‘and so on’ and is 
used at the end of a list to show it is not complete. Therefore,
using such as and etc. together is redundant.

**** Incorrect
Studies of methodology and process of implementing remanufacturing
mainly focus on durable products such as automobile motors, 
printers, and etc.11
**** Correct
	Studies of methodology and process of implementing remanufacturing 
        mainly focus on durable products such as automobile motors, 
        and printers.

Such as means that an incomplete list will be given and should 
not be used when a complete list is given.
 


**** Incorrect
	Compared to traditional industry, Micro-electronic 
        fabrication has three characteristics such as high 
        complexity, high precision and high automation.
**** Correct
	Compared to traditional industry, Micro-electronic 
        fabrication has 
        three characteristics: high complexity, high precision 
        and high automation.

        
** Section 2

1)	Some words have identical singular and plural forms and do not 
need an s added on to make them plural. These words include:
•	literature (when referring to research)
•	equipment,
•	staff (referring to a group of people)
•	faculty

1) Avoid redundancy in the following types of phrases frequently
 used by Chinese English writers

    | Instead of            | Say         | Or say      |
    |-----------------------+-------------+-------------|
    | Research work         | Research    | Work        |
    | Limit condition       | Limit       | condition   |
    | Knowledge memory      | Knowledge   | Memory      |
    | Sketch map            | Sketch      | map         |
    | Layout scheme         | Layout      | scheme      |
    | Arrangement plan      | Arrangement | plan        |
    | Output performance    | Output      | performance |
    | Simulation results    | results     | simulation  |
    | Knowledge information | Knowledge   | information |
    | Calculation results   | results     | calculation |
    | Application results   | Results     | Application |

2) Certain words demand that the noun they modify is plural

 . These include different, various, and number words.

    | Don’t write          | Instead write         |
    |----------------------+-----------------------|
    | Different node       | Different nodes       |
    | Various method       | Various methods       |
    | Two advantage        | Two advantages        |
    | Fifteen thermocouple | Fifteen thermocouples |

3) Never begin an English sentence with abbreviations and Arabic
 numerals such as Fig.
and 8. Instead write Figure and Eight.

4) Do not write ‘by this way’. Instead write ‘by doing this’, or

5) ‘using this method’.

6) Never write ‘How to…’ at the beginning of a sentence. (Don’t say it ither.)
 


No	How to find the optimal parameter is the main objective.
Yes	Determining how to find the optimal parameter is the 
main objective.

7)	Do write ‘the results are shown in Figure 2’. Do not write ‘the results are showed as
Figure 2’.

8) Italicize variables appearing in the text to differentiate them
   from words. This is especially important when the variables are English alphabets. Write ‘The graph shows t, a, and C as a function of time’. Do not write ‘The graph shows t, a, and C as a function of time’.
9) Refrain from using the word obviously in a technical paper in the following way No	Obviously, detecting regimes by means of PMH maps is a novel method.8
Yes	Detecting regimes by means of PMH maps is a novel method.8

10)	International papers should not use location dependant terms such as ‘at home’, ‘abroad’, ‘here’, ‘our country’ because the reader most likely is not Chinese and not in China. Instead, write ‘in China’.

11)	Avoid overusing the phrases ‘that is to say’ and ‘namely’. Instead, try to convey your meaning in one sentence.

12)	Do not use ‘too’ at the end of a written sentence, especially in a technical paper.
